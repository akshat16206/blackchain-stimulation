# blockchain-stimulation

It is a simple Blockchain Simulation in Python.
It mimics the core feature of a Blockchain . This stimulation includes the basic and core components like Block Structure , Block Number(INDEX) , Timestamp, List of Dummy Transcation , Hash of Previous Block and Current Block Hash.

It uses SHA-256 to genrate the Block's Hash based on its data and the previous Block.

It also implement a basic Proof of Work mechanism to make Block creation computationally intensive.

The things it shows in output is Blockchain , its details, and the mechanism to tamper with the data and demonstrate how the Chain detects tampering.
