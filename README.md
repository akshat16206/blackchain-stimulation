# blockchain-stimulation

it is a simple blockchain simulation n python.
it mimics the core feature of a blockchain . This stimulation includes the basic and core components like block structure , block number , timestamp, list of dummy transcation , hash of previous block , current block hash. it uses SHA-256 o genrate the block's hash based on its data and the previous block.

it also implement a basic proof of work mechanism to make block creation computationally intensive.

the things it shows in output is blockchain , its details, and the mechanism to tamper with the data and demonstrate how the hain detects tampering.



thankyou!!
